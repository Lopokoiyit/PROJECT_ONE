#World Population #Trend analysis based on Highest and Lowest population

##World Population– �Trend analysis based on last 5 or 10 years Highest Population Countries- Top 5 or 10 ? * Employment trend for last 5 years
** Factors for employment growth or decline ** Industries providing highest employment * Economy trend for last 5 years ** Factors for economy growth or decline

##World Population – �Trend analysis for next 5 years Highest/Lowest Population Countries * Population growth trend for next 5 years * Employment trend for next 5 years
** Factors for employment growth or decline -- Industries providing highest employment and lowest employment - - Economy trend for next 5 years -- Factors (GDP , exports, imports etc) for economy growth or decline

##Data required for the project INPUT data Countries and population ( Including Birth/death rate) – Last 5 or 10 years Countries and employment by industry ( Services, Agriculture, Hospitality, Tourism, Software) – last 5 or 10 years Countries and GDP (also include Imports, Exports) – Last 5 or 10 years.

OUTPUT data Countries and population ( Including Birth/death rate) – Next 5 or 10 years Countries and employment by industry ( Services, Agriculture, Hospitality, Tourism, Software) – Next 5 or 10 years Countries and GDP (also include Imports, Exports) – Next 5 or 10 years.

##Final Analysis Is Highest populated countries are benefited based on the population when compare with lowest populated countries ? Based on the below trend analysis of last and next 5 years
Population vs Employment ratio Population vs GDP Population vs No of Industries Population vs Younger generation.
